# DiscoPoP - Discovery of Potential Parallelism
DiscoPoP is an open-source tool that helps software developers parallelize their programs with threads. In a nutshell, DiscoPoP performs the following steps:
* detects the smallest basic blocks (computational units) suitable for parallelization,
* identifies data dependences in a program,  
* finds parallel patterns which can be used to parallelize a code region,
* and finally suggests OpenMP parallelization constructs and clauses to programmers.

DiscoPoP is built on top of LLVM. Therefore, DiscoPoP can perform the above-mentioned steps on any source code which can be transferred into the LLVM IR.


## Getting started
### Pre-requisites
Before doing anything, you need a basic development setup. We have tested DiscoPoP on Ubuntu, and the prerequisite packages should be installed using the following command:

	sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake

Additionally, you need LLVM installed on your system. Currently, DiscoPoP supports LLVM 8.0 above. Lower versions are not supported, due to API changes which lead to compilation failure. Please follow the installation tutorial [here](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html), if you have not installed LLVM before.

### DiscoPoP profiler installation
First, clone the source code into the designated folder. Then, create a build directory:

	mkdir build; cd build;

Next configure the project using CMake. The preferred LLVM installation path for DiscoPoP can be set using the -DLLVM_DIST_PATH=<PATH_TO_LLVM_BUILD_FOLDER> CMake variable.

	cmake -DLLVM_DIST_PATH=<PATH_TO_LLVM_BUILD_FOLDER> ..

Once the configuration process is successfully finished, run `make` to compile and obtain the DiscoPoP libraries. All the shared objects will be stored in the build directory under a folder named as `libi/`.


### Running DiscoPoP
DiscoPoP contains different tools for analyzing the target sequential application, namely CUGeneration, DPInstrumentation, and DPReduction. In the following, we will explain how to run each of them. However, before executing anything, please run the `dp-fmap` script in the root folder of the target application to obtain the list of files. The output will be written in a file named `FileMapping.txt`.

	<DISCOPOP_PATH>/scripts/dp-fmap

#### CU Generation 
To obtain the computational unit (CU) graph of the target application, please run the following command.

	clang++ -g -O0 -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -load -Xclang <PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/libi/LLVMCUGeneration.so -mllvm -fm-path -mllvm ./FileMapping.txt -c <C_File>

#### DiscoPoP Profiling
To obtain data dependences, we need to instrument the target application: 

	clang -g -O0 -S -emit-llvm -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -load -Xclang <PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/libi/LLVMDPInstrumentation.so -mllvm -fm-path -mllvm ./FileMapping.txt -c <C_File> -o out.ll

(IF NEEDED) Use llvm-link to link multiple .ll files into one:

	llvm-link $out.ll other.ll -o out.ll

(OPTIONAL) You may run the `DPInstrumentationOmission` pass to omit non-essential instructions from profiling to improve performance. To preserve input-sensitivity of the profiler, add the `-input-sensitive` flag. Add the `-stats` flag to get information about the number of omitted instructions.

	opt -S -load=<PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/libi/LLVMDPInstrumentationOmission.so -dp-instrumentation-omission out.ll -o out.ll

Make the application executable:
	
	clang++ out.ll-L<PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/rtlib -lDiscoPoP_RT -lpthread -o <APP_NAME>

 Running the application will result in a text file containing all the dependences located in the present working directory

	./<APP_NAME>

#### Identifying Reduction Operations
To obtain the list of reduction operations in the target application, we need to instrument the target application. Running the instrumented application will result in a text file containing all the reductions located in the present working directory.

	clang++ -g -O0 -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -load -Xclang <PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/libi/LLVMDPReduction.so -mllvm -fm-path -mllvm ./FileMapping.txt -c <C_File> -o out.o
	clang++ out.o -L<PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_DIR>/rtlib -lDiscoPoP_RT -lpthread
	./<APP_NAME>
	
*NOTE:* Please use the exact compiler flags that we used. Otherwise, you might not get the correct results, or the analysis might fail.

#### Pattern Detection
Once you have all the results generated by DiscoPoP passes, you can use them for detecting parallel patterns. To learn more, please read the pattern detection [README](/graph_analyzer/README.md), which explains how to run pattern detection in detail. 


## Troubleshooting
### How to use DiscoPoP with projects which use CMake build system?
To run DiscoPoP instrumentation on projects which use CMake, you need to use the following commands instead of normal CMake.
1. You first need to run CMake to just configure the project for compilation:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<PATH_TO_CLANG> -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-c -g -O0 -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -load -Xclang <PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_FOLDER>/libi/LLVMDPInstrumentation.so -mllvm -fm-path -mllvm <PATH_TO_FILE_MAPPING>"
```
2. Then, configure the project for linking:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<PATH_TO_CLANG> -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-g -O0 -fno-discard-value-names -Xclang -load -Xclang <PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_FOLDER>/libi/LLVMDPInstrumentation.so -mllvm -fm-path -mllvm <PATH_TO_FILE_MAPPING>" -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES="-L<PATH_TO_DISCOPOP_BUILD_FOLDER>/rtlib -lDiscoPoP_RT -lpthread" .
```
3. Running `make` will build the project with DiscoPoP instrumentation applied on the code.
